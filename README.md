## 🎯 Why WAC-Saver?

WhatsApp doesn't offer a native way to save chats in a clean, shareable format. WAC-Saver solves this problem by:

- Converting messy `.txt` exports into professional PDF
- Processing everything locally for **complete privacy**
- Maintaining the original chat structure and readability
- Providing a fast, no-nonsense solution without sign-ups or subscriptions

1. **Export** your WhatsApp chat:
   - Open WhatsApp → Select chat → ⋮ Menu → More → Export chat → Without media
2. **Open** WAC-Saver in your browser
3. **Upload** the exported `.txt` file
4. The app **formats** your chat and prepares the PDF
5. **Download** instantly — nothing is stored, uploaded, or logged
